Aside from using points to book flights,  [Aeroplan](https://princeoftravel.com/points-programs/aeroplan/)  members can choose to redeem them for hotel stays instead, giving members more flexibility to redeem their points for travel arrangements beyond flights.

Under the latest promotion for redeeming points for hotel stays, Aeroplan members can get  **up to 20,000 Aeroplan points back on hotel redemptions,**  for bookings made from  **June 10–28, 2024,**  and travel through to  **December 31, 2024.**

## Aeroplan Hotel Points Back Promotion: Up to 20,000 Points Back

All  [Aeroplan](https://princeoftravel.com/points-programs/aeroplan/)  members are eligible for this promotion to receive up to 20,000 points back on hotel redemptions.

You’ll first need to  [register](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/aeroplan/promotions/hotel-points-back-offer.html#/), and then complete an eligible booking during the promotion’s validity period, which is as follows:

-   **Register and book between June 10 and June 28, 2024**
-   **Travel between June 10 and December 31, 2024**

To register, simply head to  [the promotion’s landing page](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/aeroplan/promotions/hotel-points-back-offer.html#/), enter your Aeroplan number, agree to the Terms and Conditions, and click “Register now”.

![](http://princeoftravel.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screen-Shot-2024-06-11-at-3.47.34-PM.png)

After registering, Aeroplan members will be able to get up to 20,000 Aeroplan points back on eligible hotel redemptions made through Aeroplan’s hotel-booking platform.

The amount of points you’ll get back depends on how many points you’ve redeemed for your stay, structured as follows:

-   Redeem at least  **30,000 points,**  get  **5,000 points back**
-   Redeem at least  **60,000 points,**  get  **10,000 points back**
-   Redeem  **90,000 points or more,**  get  **20,000 points back**

![](http://princeoftravel.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screen-Shot-2024-06-11-at-3.51.12-PM.png)

Plus, if you have  [Aeroplan Elite Status](https://princeoftravel.com/guides/aeroplan-elite-status/), you’ll  **enjoy an additional 2,500 points back per eligible redemption.**

This offer can be combined with the recently introduced  [Fourth Night Free benefit](https://princeoftravel.com/news/aeroplan-introduces-fourth-night-free-feature-for-hotel-bookings/), which offers cardholders of any Aeroplan co-branded credit card a fourth night free when they redeem Aeroplan points for hotel stays. In other words, you’ll only pay in points for three nights for a four-night stay.

    Aeroplan Introduces Fourth Night Free Feature for Hotel Bookings
    

As per the terms and conditions, points will be rebated into the Aeroplan account within six weeks after travel takes place.

This time, there’s no limit to the number of stays that qualify for this promotion. The promotion applies to all bookings (new and existing) within the promotional travel period, as long as registration is completed prior to June 28, 2024.

## Is Booking Hotels with Aeroplan Points a Good Deal?

Generally speaking, we at Prince of Travel believe that you’ll get the best value by using your  [Aeroplan](https://princeoftravel.com/points-programs/aeroplan/)  points for booking flights, especially in premium cabins.

However, it’s worth noting that not everyone uses points for flight bookings, and Aeroplan offers members another option for redeeming points for travel experiences by allowing members to redeem for hotel stays.

Plus, with  [HotelSavers](https://princeoftravel.com/uncategorized/aeroplan-introduces-new-hotelsavers-feature-for-booking-hotels/)  (which offer discounted rates) and the Fourth Night Free benefit, Aeroplan has introduced ways for members to get additional value from their points if they redeem them for hotel stays, especially during promotions that also offer points back.

![](http://princeoftravel.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/img_660ef90e340c8.)

Redeem Aeroplan points for hotels with HotelSavers

Based on our previous analyses, you can expect to get an average redemption value of around  **1.7–1.8 cents per point (CAD)**  on hotel bookings, which is lower than  [our valuation of Aeroplan points](https://princeoftravel.com/points-valuations/)  at 2.1 cents per point (CAD).

However, it’s also possible to get higher value than this with hotel bookings, especially if you’re able to leverage HotelSavers and the recently introduced  [Fourth Night Free benefit](https://princeoftravel.com/news/aeroplan-introduces-fourth-night-free-feature-for-hotel-bookings/). Plus, it’s worth noting that you can also wind up with lower value than this for flight bookings.

As a reminder, Aeroplan co-branded credit cardholders get a Fourth Night Free when redeeming Aeroplan points for each three-night stay, through to December 31, 2024.

Therefore, to maximize the current offer, you could look for hotel stays that price out as close to the 30,000, 60,000, or 90,000-point thresholds as possible, which would be enough to trigger getting 5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 points back, respectively.

Ideally, you’d also stack this with the Fourth Night Free benefit, and if you have Aeroplan Elite Status, you’ll enjoy an additional 2,500 points back per eligible stay.

For example, you might book a four-night stay in Kuala Lumpur for  **60,900 points**  (an average of  **15,225 points per night),**  with the Fourth Night Free benefit included.

![](http://princeoftravel.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Screen-Shot-2024-06-11-at-4.22.25-PM.png)

Since you’d get 10,000 points back with the current promotion, the effective cost of the stay drops down to  **50,900 points.**  If you were to pay cash instead, the stay would price out at  **$1026.91 (CAD).**

In this example, you’d wind up with a value of  **2.15 cents per point (CAD),**  which is right on par with our valuation of Aeroplan points.

Again, it’s certainly possible to get more or less value on hotel bookings made with Aeroplan points, since it varies depending on the hotel. Just be sure to crunch the numbers prior to making a redemption to ensure you’re happy with the value you get.

## Conclusion

[Aeroplan](https://princeoftravel.com/points-programs/aeroplan/)  has launched a new Points Back promotion for hotel stays, which offers members up to 20,000 points back when redeeming Aeroplan points for hotel stays. Plus, Aeroplan Elite Status members will enjoy an additional 2,500 points back per eligible stay.

You’ll need to  [register first](https://www.aircanada.com/ca/en/aco/home/aeroplan/promotions/hotel-points-back-offer.html#/)  before June 28, 2024, and then travel on an eligible booking through to  **December 31, 2024.**

To get the most from the promotion, try to stack the points-back offer with the  [Fourth Night Free](https://princeoftravel.com/news/aeroplan-introduces-fourth-night-free-feature-for-hotel-bookings/)  benefit for  [Aeroplan co-branded credit cardholders](https://princeoftravel.com/guides/how-do-the-11-aeroplan-credit-cards-compare/).
